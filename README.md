### Contents
 - Unity prefab containing 10 gates (6x 1x1, 2x 1x2, 2x 2x1)
 - FBX File (44 triangles)
 - UV template
 - texture and alternate design

### Requirement
 - [Poiyomi Toon Shader](https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader)
 - [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/)
 - Some available parameter space for toggles

### Setup
1. Import package into Unity
2. Drag prefab onto avatar
3. Done :)

### Optional
Want more gates? You can duplicate the game objects but you will need to make new toggles to enable them.

### To-Do (maybe)
- Add more obstacles types (flag, barrier etc)
Nothing big. Something better will likely replace this :)

### Credits
The gate's specs are based on the MultiGP 5x5 standard chapter gate:
