# VRC Drone Gate
A simple set of obstacles for a VRChat Drone course. Single sided flat UV layout to easily make you own designs.
**Right now the only object is a 5ft x 5ft gate. I may add more in future.**

### Contents
 - FBX File (44 triangles)
 - UV template
 - Sample texture

### Requirements
[VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/)

### Setup
1. Import into Unity
2. Drag object onto avatar in heirarchy
3. Create a matierial using the texture
4. Position how you like. I use mostly in desktop so I position slightly in front of my body
5. (OPTIONAL) You can get fancy and parent objects to a wrist bone for a VR drop. This complicates toggles
6. Add a VRCFury Toggle script to your avatar
7. Name your toggle and add two actions: object toggle, world drop
8. Duplicate the object and toggle for as many gates as you have

**Tip:** Stack the gates and group under one game object to make ladders and 2x1s

### To-Do (maybe)
- Add more obstacles (flag, barrier etc)
Nothing big. Something better will likely replace this :)

### Credits
The gate's specs are based on the MultiGP 5x5 standard chapter gate:
